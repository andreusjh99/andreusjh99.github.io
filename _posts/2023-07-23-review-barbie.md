**Barbie** is a sharp and precise commentary on the complicated legacy of the titular toy, yet it is also a colourful and vibrant film about what it means to be human.

Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives her perfect existence in a matriarchal world, Barbieland. In this Barbie-dominated world, Barbie is everything – from doctors, writers, Nobel Prize winners, to politicians. Living in the shadow of the Barbies are the Kens, whose sole job is to “beach”, which literally means to look cool on the beach. One day, plagued by thoughts of death and various afflictions like “flat-feet” and cellulite, Barbie is no longer feeling like her perfect self. To fix this, she now has to venture into the Real World, while Beach Ken (Ryan Gosling) decides to come along with her. Both Barbie and Ken end up on an unexpected journey of self-discovery.

Barbie is an excellent piece of filmmaking. The film is touching, emotional, funny, witty and sharp. It was expectedly complex, but surprisingly philosophical. Greta Gerwig has once again proven herself to be one of the most talented filmmakers in the industry with Barbie, but first and foremost, she is a brilliant writer. Barbie is laced with complex themes and ideas about feminism and existentialism, which are unpacked and dissected in a way that is refreshing and thoughtful. I am impressed by the central conceit of Barbie and Ken from Barbieland, which is effectively a mirror image of our society, learning about our world. It is genuinely brilliant and provides a different and sometimes satirical perspective on modern feminism.

Barbie also provides commentaries on Mattel, the creator of the Barbie doll, and on the complicated legacy of the controversial toy. There is no denying that the toy has been a subject of controversy throughout the years since its conception due to its influence on the image of women. Yes, it is also undeniable that Barbie has been an important part of the childhood of many people. The film is a brilliant balancing act in portraying both the positive and negative impacts of the titular toy on our culture. It celebrates Barbie with endearing love and joy while also fearlessly satirising its legacy. While Barbie and Ken grapple with an identity crisis, the film also delves into self-reflection on Mattel and Barbie and explores what the toy might signify for this new generation.

The film has a big heart. You can feel the filmmakers’ love for Barbie and its lore from the attention they pay to the details and their craft. The production design is immaculate. The cardboard cutouts, backdrops, and practical sets allow the film to have a very theatrical yet grounded nature. For film lovers, the film is chock-full of film references, ranging from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Matrix (which are apparent from the brilliant trailers) to The Godfather and Justice League. Amidst all of this passion, most importantly, the film strikes an emotional chord with me in its exploration of the meaning of existence. I found myself shedding tears by the end of the film, which I genuinely did not expect.

Margot Robbie is perfect for the titular role. It is not difficult to see how her physical appearance is a perfect match for the role of Barbie, but what Robbie truly brings to the role is her immense talent. Robbie provides such depth in her performance in uncovering the layers beneath a character who is supposed to be always joyful but experiencing existential crisis. By the end of the film, she has truly made the role her own. The same goes for Ryan Gosling as the charismatic Ken who goes to some surprising places as a character. Gosling is genuinely funny in the film and an absolute scene-stealer. Will Farrell as the allegorical corporate executive of Mattel is also a hoot.

Mark Ronson’s soundtrack compilation bursts with colours and energy. Dua Lipa’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1vYXt7VSjH9JIM5oRRo7vA?si=304afce6f8434317" target="_blank">“Dance the Night”</a> is an absolute earworm, and a power ballad by Ryan Gosling – <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3zXIvb4nZ3cTdT8CsbTy3U?si=38e683cdbdb4418e" target="_blank">“I’m Just Ken”</a> — is brilliant and powerful. I adore and enjoy every dance number in the film as they just exude such joy and energy. I am slightly disappointed, however, by the absence of Cass Elliot’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6H3Wa6hWR9DRMzMSd4pZkT?si=93912cfe350f49f9" target="_blank">“Make Your Own Kind of Music”</a> which was featured in the trailer, as I thought it would have been perfect for the tone and message of the film.

The film is definitely not without its flaws. One particular quibble that I have with the film is that, much like its characters suffering from identity crisis, the film sometimes feel uncertain about its target audience. The marketing and build-up to the release certainly point towards its publicly-perceived demographic: little kids, who I believe will end up making up a huge portion of the audience, as evident in the screening I attended. While I expect the dance numbers and several sequences in the first act to resonate with its perceived target audience, I doubt some of the complex ideas and humour in the film will be understood or appreciated by kids in general.

All in all, Barbie is a multi-faceted film about one of the most influential toys ever made, and it is full of heart, joy and never fears to poke fun and reflect on its complicated history. It is also a film about important ideas, especially the question of what makes us human. I definitely recommend the film.
