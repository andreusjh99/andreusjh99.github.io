More than two decades after the release of the supposedly final installment in the franchise, Death is back in cinemas. Clocking in at 110 minutes, **Final Destination Bloodlines** is the longest entry in the series so far, breaking the 90-minute trend for the franchise.

Bloodlines opens formulaically with a grand disaster that takes the lives of many, like its predecessors. This time it is set in the late 60s, when Iris (Brec Bassinger as young Iris, Gabrielle Rose as elder Iris) and her boyfriend (Max Lloyd-Jones) attend the opening ceremony of the Skyview Restaurant Tower. A coin hits the ventilation fan, one thing leads to another like a stack of dominoes, and the dancing guests in the top floor soon rain down through the shattered glass as the tower collapses due to a massive explosion. Fear not, however, as viewers familiar with the franchise would know that it is only a premonition, and Iris manages to intervene, saving not only a select few as is the case in previous films, but actually stopping the accident from happening. 

The survivors of that night are hunted by Death soon after. As there are many, it takes time for Death to do the rounds. Many survivors have had children, and even grandchildren – lives that should never have existed in the eyes of Death. One such family is Iris’s, whose granddaughter Stefani (Kaitlyn Stana Juana) is having nightmares about the premonition from decades ago. Determined to find answers, she visits Iris who is now estranged from the family. Inevitably, Death finally comes knocking on their doors, determined to claim the lives of the family once and for all.

Let me preface this by clarifying that I am a huge fan of the franchise. It is truly a guilty pleasure of mine, and I cannot count the number of times I have watched every installment. From the teaser and the first trailer, I have been highly anticipating what may be in store in this latest entry. The ingenious teaser concept and the glass shard in ice for the trailer are truly exciting elements for the franchise, and they got me very excited for the film – in fact, the most excited I have been for any film in the last few years. It is safe to say that Bloodlines did not disappoint. A truly enjoyable and thrilling ride from start to finish, I wished the film had been longer.

From the opening accident, the film captures fear and paranoia very effectively. It accurately portrays what it is like to experience vertigo, and as someone who has a fear for heights, my palms became sweaty very quickly. There are clever subversions that manage to keep viewers on their toes at all times, as well as some ingenious setups for the deaths in the film. Jam-packed with direct and indirect references to previous instalments, Bloodlines never feel pandering or overtly self-referential, but is always purposeful with the references and symbolism that make it feel like a full-circle moment with the rest of the series. It is also the funniest in the series with genuinely laugh-out-loud moments along with the high-camp nature of the deaths.

While Bloodlines is not the revolutionary reinvention of the franchise that the filmmakers promised it would be, it certainly keeps up the bloodiness and the campiness that made the franchise great fun. Fans looking for lore expansion might be disappointed, but enigmatic coroner William Bludworth makes a final appearance in the franchise before actor Tony Todd’s death, and the film provides a satisfying backstory for the character that feels right and, in some ways, heart-warming.

All in all, Final Destination Bloodlines is an entry well worth the wait for fans of the franchise. While detractors may not find themselves jumping on board after this film, fans will certainly find much to love and enjoy, as it is bloody, silly, and stupid in the best way possible, with its only flaw being that it is too short. Needless to say, the franchise has not reached its final destination just yet.
