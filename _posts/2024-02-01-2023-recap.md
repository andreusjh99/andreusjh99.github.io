It’s the new year. I thought it would be fun and interesting to look back at the films I watched last year. Inspired by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm057BcL-JK/" target="_blank">Edgar Wright’s Instagram post</a> from the start of last year where he listed the films he watched in 2022, I decided to follow suit and keep track of the films I watched in 2023, see how well I do as a growing cinephile.

## The List

I have watched a total of 182 films last year, ranging from the silent films in the 1920s to the latest features in 2023. This came just short of the goal of 200 films I set at the start of the year, partly due to a busier work schedule than anticipated. Note that the number of films indicate number of unique films, not the total number of viewings - films like Oppenheimer or The Dark Knight are counted only once.

Here is a breakdown by decade.

I also kept track of the number of first-time watches in the year. With 117 new films watched, this sets the ratio of first-time-watch to total number of films at 64.3% - surpassing my goal of 50%.

### Statistics:
-	<b>Decade with most films watched</b>: 2010s

    This seemed interesting to me at first, as I generally felt that I was watching more films from the 20th century. However, looking at the data, the 2010s is the decade which had the lowest first-time-watch to total ratio by decade – 37.2% (16 out of 43). This reflects my attachment to films that I grew up with, as I am more inclined to rewatch films from that decade than any other decades. This is evident because 27 out of 65 films (41.5%) that I have rewatched in the year are from that decade.

-	<b>Number of years</b>: 59 different years

-	<b>Year with most films watched</b>: 2023 with 22 films

    This is not surprising as I have been paying more attention to film releases this year, though 22 is not a huge number as I was mostly focused on going back in time and watching older films.

-	<b>Oldest film watched</b>: The Gold Rush (1925)

    The Gold Rush is a comedy classic directed by the great Charlie Chaplin. I decided to watch the film primarily because I have seen clips from films by Chaplin but never properly watched a full-length feature. The Gold Rush is a splendid piece of slapstick comedy, full of heart, humour and occasionally even terror.

-	<b>Film watched the most</b>: Oppenheimer (4 times)

    As I wrote in my [review]({% post_url 2023-07-30-review-Oppenheimer %}), I loved the film to pieces. Having seen it 4 times now on the biggest screen possible, I love it even more.

-	<b>Number of visits to the cinema</b>: 27

    A huge proportion of that is for Nolan’s films. Celebrating Warner Bros’ 100th anniversary, the local cinema chain created ticket bundles of 4 Warner Bros’ films, three of which are Nolan’s, which I happily bought. As a result, I watched Inception, Interstellar (twice) and The Dark Knight (twice) in the cinema, to great pleasure.

-	<b>Directors with the most films watched</b>:
    1.	<b>Spielberg</b>: 12
        
        I started going through filmography of celebrated directors, and Spielberg was on the top of my list. I am by no means at the end, but I admire Spielberg’s versatility and ability as a filmmaker and story-teller.

    2.	<b>Nolan</b>: 11

        There is really no surprise given what I mentioned above. 2023 is the year of Nolan for me, as I revisit his classics and catch up on his lesser-known works like Following and Insomnia, making him one of the few directors whose filmography I have watched completely.

    3.	<b>Miyazaki</b>: 7

        Miyazaki is perhaps my favourite filmmaker since childhood, thanks to my mother’s introduction of Spirited Away. With the release of his latest feature, [The Boy and The Heron]({% post_url 2023-12-17-review-the-boy-and-the-heron %}), I have been going down memory lane and revisiting some of his classics.

All in all, although the total number of films has fallen short of expectation, I am rather pleased with the diversity of films I have watched in terms of genres, directors and decades. I hope to keep it up and grow as a film-lover (part-time film reviewer) in the new year.

Finally, a customary list. Here are my top 10 films of all time (for now).
