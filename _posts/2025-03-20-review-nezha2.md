Adapted from the classic 16th-century Chinese fantasy novel Investiture of the Gods (封神演义), **Ne Zha 2** (or **Ne Zha: The Demon Child Churns the Sea**) is the latest animated epic and sequel to the rip-roaring 2019 film. Having been in theatres for less than 2 months, it is already the 5th highest-grossing film of all time to date, surpassing the likes of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Avengers: Infinity War.

Following the events of the first film, Ne Zha (Lü Yanting as child, Joseph Cao as adolescent) and Ao Bing (Han Mo), with the help of Taiyi (Zhang Jiaming), are now in a race against time to keep their souls from disappearing after their physical bodies are destroyed by heavenly lightning. Believing his son to be dead, Ao Guang, the Dragon King, brings an army of demons and exiled dragons to attack the town where they are residing, inadvertently disintegrating Ao Bing’s newly generated body in the process. Determined to save his only friend, Ne Zha shares his body with Ao Bing and sets off to complete three trials to become a xian (some form of deity) in exchange for an elixir that will allow Ao Bing’s body to be regenerated. Meanwhile, a plot is slowly hatching among unknown forces to take down the Dragon tribe once and for all.

2019’s Ne Zha is a spectacular debut feature by director Jiaozi that manages to have its cake and eat it, balancing spectacle and story, action and drama, adrenaline and tears. While taking creative liberties with its source material, Jiaozi crafts a story that emphasises the core spirit of the titular character without sacrificing the intricate world-building and character dynamics that have captivated readers and audiences for centuries. Half a decade later, he is back with a sequel that takes both the story and spectacle to another level, weaving in plot complexities that unveil the greyness of morality and the duality of good and evil even further.

The story picks up directly after the events of the first film but the themes this time are slightly different. Ideas like nature versus nurture, and defiance against authority and destiny, while still present, become secondary to the story. Instead, the film focuses on preconceptions of evil and the dual nature of morality – themes that are prevalent in classic Chinese mythology fiction like Journey to the West (西游记) and Water Margin (水浒传). Unexpectedly, the themes are portrayed most vividly through a side character, Shen Gongbao, who was the most antagonistic-looking character in the first film but now takes on more of an anti-hero archetype. Ne Zha and Ao Bing, while central to the plot, are therefore unfortunately sidelined in terms of the spirit of the film. Quotes like ‘my destiny belongs to me, not to the heavens’ feel less impactful as a result compared to the first film.

What has improved drastically in the sequel is its spectacle, and by leaps and bounds, the filmmakers stepped up their game. No words can serve justice to the mind-blowing animation and jaw-dropping imagery on display. Sitting in the theatre, I was completely in awe. The third act, which lasted close to an hour, was perhaps the most intense and mind-pulverising experience I have ever had in a cinema. We have come a long way since Pixar released the world’s first 3D-animated feature film, Toy Story, back in 1995. Ne Zha 2 is both a triumph and celebration of the format, pushing the limits as to what animation can achieve in terms of story-telling, world-building, and choreography. The <a href="https://youtu.be/fq6LrurCMMg?si=W47G6zTCDMWqwiUv" target="_blank">behind-the-scenes documentary</a> is a great complementary watch to truly appreciate the terrific effort put into making the film a reality. I highly recommend it.

In cinema, you can’t have sight without sound. The score by Roc Chen, Rui Yang and Wan Pin Chu is a perfect blend of Western and Eastern influences. Featuring a typical Western orchestra, the score is also interlaced with traditional Chinese instruments like the suona and pipa, as well as traditional folk music from various regions in China. The result is a culturally rich sonic template that matches the extravagant visuals. One particular theme that stuck with me is the theme for a cauldron, the Tianyuan Ding, which features Tuvan-Mongol throat singing. The deep gurgling sound roaring through the scene brings to life the sacred yet ominous nature of the cauldron.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and cannot wait to see it again on the big screen soon. While the themes might not be as impactful as in the first film, the spectacle certainly blows me away - by a far mile.
