**Wonka** is the newest and third film based on the classic magical chocolatier, Willy Wonka, a character created by Roald Dahl in his 1964 novel, “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”. Following the Gene Wilder-led “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory” in 1971 and Johnny Depp-led remake in 2005, Timothée Chalamet now takes on the classic role in Paul King’s new origin story for the character. 

In an unknown year, Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) arrives with “12 silver sovereigns in (his) pocket and a hatful of dreams” in a town that looks like a fusion of various European cities. Unwittingly, he burns through his money and is unable to pay for boarding at Mrs. Scrubitt’s (Olivia Colman), who takes him in for the night. Wonka signs a contract with Scrubitt to stay for the night, unaware of the traps laid for him in the fine print. 

To pay them off, Wonka heads to the Gallery Gourmet the next day to sell his brand-new chocolate. Successfully dazzling the people, his earnings, however, are confiscated by the police. Unable to pay back the monumental fees incurred in the fine print of the contract, Wonka is captured to work for Scrubitt along with other captives, though Wonka is still optimistic about his dream to open a chocolate shop here at the Gallery Gourmet. Little does he know that there are other dangers lying ahead, including a group of monopolising rival chocolatiers known as the Chocolate Cartel.

Wonka is a sweet and heart-warming film for the family and the holidays, filled with wonderful musical set pieces, comic greatness and chocolate. While the 1971 original is an enchanting moral tale for kids with a dark edge and the 2005 remake is a darker reimagination of Roald Dahl’s novel infused with the signature Tim Burton twisted-fairy-tale energy, Paul King’s latest musical film brings back the enchanted quality of the original, sprinkled with additional sweetness and liveliness. Watching the film, I feel the same anticipation, awe and giddiness that I felt watching the original – something that I missed in Tim Burton’s remake. 

Filled with light-hearted yet hilarious performances by everyone on screen, down to even the side characters, the film made me laugh plenty of times. The titular character, brilliantly portrayed by Chalamet, is optimistic, innocent, and sometimes maniacal, sitting somewhere between the friendly but weary Gene Wilder performance and the introverted but chirpy Johnny Depp performance. Olivia Colman and Tom Davies are hilarious as a dual act, while the Paterson Joseph-led Chocolate Cartel is absolutely splendid and memorable to watch, particularly in their key musical number <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5a1aZ8imxtifdzQPftBTma?si=7620649b84dd4cf4" target="_blank">“Sweet Tooth”</a>.

The original songs in the film are contributed by Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy, while the musical score is by Joby Talbot, whose work for the British sitcom “The League of Gentlemen” I enjoyed very much. The musical numbers are lovely, and the songs are catchy, magical, and brilliant – a perfect blend of Broadway, Disney, and Gene Kelly. The opening track <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0FILw3ZbdxQFxR0ci91ONt?si=a553e565c6f84bcf" target="_blank">“A Hatful of Dreams”</a>, charmingly performed by a surprisingly versatile Chalamet, is an immediate classic. From that track alone, I was immediately on board with the film. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1ZfYtdc9FXkRmVXyNXxjoy?si=a2d66e809e7e45ac" target="_blank">“A World of Your Own”</a> is a great addition to the catalogue of songs in the franchise and a youthful, innocent companion to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4f4HLo6L9CJNhD4mEYxrCL?si=2cab6528dce640b1" target="_blank">“Pure Imagination”</a>.

All in all, Wonka is a heart-warming film that, in my opinion, brings back the wonder and imagination of the original the remake lacked. Led by a strong performance and filled with colourful music, the film is a funny, lovely, and a magical treat for the family.
