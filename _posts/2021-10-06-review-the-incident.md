**El Incidente** is a metaphorical Sci-fi thriller with an important lesson about life. 

Oliver and his brother, Carlos, enter a stairwell chased by a police officer. Soon enough, to their dismay, they find themselves stuck in the never-ending stairwell with the officer on their tail and Carlos injured from a gunshot. Meanwhile, a family goes on a road trip, only to find themselves horrified upon realising they are going down a never-ending highway. The events seem disconnected at first, but slowly the truth emerges.

The Spanish fantasy flick released in 2014 is a didactic film which sets out to alarm us of the importance of life and motivation. With two parallel stories about both youth and adulthood, the film successfully urges its viewers to take a look at themselves and consider their own lives. It is well done for the most part. The film should be commended for its greatest strength, that is its ability to convey its core message intriguingly despite its limited budget and elements.

The film, however, suffers quite a bit from its pacing especially during the second story about the road trip. Repetitions of elements over the two stories slow down the film a lot, and the laborious and overly-expositional final sections of the film do not help. The inconsistent pacing, in my opinion, is mainly due to the filmmakers' lack of trust in the audience's ability to grasp the metaphors, thus resulting in some lengthy explanations which bloated the film. That being said, the film does leave some stones unturned. There are a couple of delightful Easter eggs worth looking out for attentive viewers.

Nothing much can be said about the performance of the cast though, as the film's characters do not offer themselves much opportunity for memorable performances. That is not a huge issue since the film captivates not with its performances but with its simplicity and message.

A well-done to Edy Lan (the music supervisor) and his team for the marvellous use of music in the film. Similarly to Rodrigo San (the cinematographer) for the beautifully-shot scenes and camera work. These are two of the many crucial elements in making watching the film a truly wonderful experience.

All in all, El Incidente is a brilliantly deep sci-fi thriller which prompts its audience to ponder and think. Although the pacing could improve, the film is still a treat and I definitely recommend it to everyone.
