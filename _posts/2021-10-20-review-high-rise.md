**High-Rise** is a film about social hierarchy and class differences, and it definitely does not shy away from criticising almost everyone from the arrogant and incompetent leader, the blind and oppressive upper class, the silent and self-protective middle class, to the delusional. 

It is 1975, and Dr. Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston) has just moved into a 40-storey tower on the outskirts of London. In this high-rise, the wealthy lives on the top floors, while the poorer lives below. Residents are able to fulfil their daily needs for survival and entertainment by frequenting the many amenities in the tower, which include a supermarket, pool, gym, spa, and primary school. As glamorous as it may be to be a part of the modern lifestyle, the hidden cracks soon become impossible to bear in this vertical miniature of a society.

The film started off steadily; however, it slowly lacks focus and descends into chaos, ironically mirroring the characters in the film. Tom Hiddleston, as amazing as always, is the one thread that prevents the film from falling apart starting from the second act onwards, but even that does not stop the film from tumbling into a mess. There is a difference between portraying chaos and being chaotic, and unfortunately, the film chooses the latter. Despite this, the film manages to find its rhythm back near the end of the final act and resolves to a rather unearned conclusion.

Themes like oppression, the clash between classes, rebellion, and especially the inaction of the middle class are infused throughout the film, which is commendable. However, the film is almost indecipherable halfway onwards that it would take the keenest eye to spot the metaphors and ideas behind the shambles. It is undoubtedly a film that requires second viewing, but I genuinely doubt if most will be willing to sit through it a second time.

Despite the lack of focus, one cannot help but appreciate the amazing work on the soundtrack and the colour palette of the film. Clint Mansell did a wonderful job with the score, and the rendition of ABBA's S.O.S. definitely is a cherry on the top. As for the visuals, the colours are comfortable and welcoming at times, yet effectively violent and dark when needed.

All in all, the film is passable. With better thought-out execution, the film could definitely do better, considering the engaging themes and performances. After sitting through the gorgeous-looking and beautiful-sounding High-Rise, I can only sigh, "What a waste!"
